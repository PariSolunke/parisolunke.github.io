                    My favourite data driven visualization is a timeline of the popularity of various music genres since the 1950s. 
                    As music and visualization are both topics which pique my interest, this was an easy choice to make.</p>
                  <p>  The visualization itself is simple to understand and is similair in some ways to the Visualization of the size of Napoleon's army in his campaign to invade Russia. Time is on the x-axis. Each genre is labeled and denoted by different shades/patterns. The thickness of each genre indicates it's popularity at that moment in time. Furthermore, it is also interactive in some ways, clicking on any genre expands it into its various subgenres and their popularities. You can also search for a genre of your choice.
